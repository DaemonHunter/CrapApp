## Payouts

### Pass Line Odds

If the point is 4 or 10, the payout ratio for odds bets is 2 to 1. This means that for every $1 bet, the player would win $2 if they roll the point number before rolling a 7.
If the point is 5 or 9, the payout ratio for odds bets is 3 to 2. This means that for every $2 bet, the player would win $3 if they roll the point number before rolling a 7.
If the point is 6 or 8, the payout ratio for odds bets is 6 to 5. This means that for every $5 bet, the player would win $6 if they roll the point number before rolling a 7.

### Place Bets

Place bet on 4 or 10: Payout of 9 to 5 (or 2 to 1 odds)
Place bet on 5 or 9: Payout of 7 to 5
Place bet on 6 or 8: Payout of 7 to 6

For example, if you have $10 on a Place bet on the number 6, and the shooter rolls a 6 before a 7, your bet would pay out at odds of 7 to 6, or $11.67 (rounded up to the nearest cent). Note that the payouts for Place bets are not based on true odds, and
 include a house edge. The house edge varies depending on the specific number being bet on, with the lowest house edge for Place bets on the 6 or 8 (1.52%) and the highest house edge for Place bets on the 4 or 10 (6.67%).

### Lay Bets

If the number is 4 or 10, the payout ratio for lay bets is 1 to 2. This means that for every $2 bet, the player would win $1 if a 7 is rolled before the chosen number.
If the number is 5 or 9, the payout ratio for lay bets is 2 to 3. This means that for every $3 bet, the player would win $2 if a 7 is rolled before the chosen number.
If the number is 6 or 8, the payout ratio for lay bets is 5 to 6. This means that for every $6 bet, the player would win $5 if a 7 is rolled before the chosen number.

When a player makes a lay bet in craps, the casino typically charges a commission, or vigorish (vig), on the amount of the bet. This commission is usually a percentage of the bet amount and is deducted from the player's winnings.

The standard commission rate for lay bets varies depending on the specific casino, but it typically ranges from 4% to 5% of the bet amount. For example, if a player makes a $20 lay bet and the commission rate is 5%, the vig would be $1 (5% of $20), and 
the player would win $19 if they win the bet.

It's worth noting that the commission on lay bets increases the house edge for these bets, making them less favorable for players than other bets like the Pass Line or Come bets, which have a lower house edge. However, lay bets can still be a useful str
ategy in certain situations, such as when the player wants to hedge their bets or take advantage of a favorable table.
